# SampleCodesofPalabos
Samples with Chinese and English explanation for Palabos beginners.

### Contents
#### BoolMask
This is for inputting 2D domain data to Palabos from binarized picture data generated by Matlab.

#### boolMask3D
This is for inputting 3D domain data to Palabos. 3D matrix was generated by padding 2D pictures in Z axis in Palabos and then output by Matlab.

boolmusk3D_plb_y was laterly added, this code generates the solid area with the picture and padding its 3rd dimension in y axis in Palabos. The code is unnecessarily complicated and may cause confusion in understanding. In the short future I won't have time to re-comment the code.

#### stl-inspection
This code is based on the example cavity3D, and will output the stl file with its center at (0,0,0) and a 100*100*100 fluid domain to give an intuitive feel of the stl file size.
